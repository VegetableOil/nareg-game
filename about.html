        <p class="about-p">Hello there, my name is David Balyan and I am the creator of this website.</p>
        
        <p class="about-p">I made this site so that my 6 year old brother could improve his math skills.</p>

        <p class="about-p">I am also improving my web developing abilities by making this website.</p>

        <p class="about-p">New game modes will be added soon. For example, you will be able to change the difficulty of the questions (bigger numbers) and you'll have the choice of how many questions you would like to answer before it's Game Over.</p>

        <p class="about-p">This website is made without the use of any website builders nor any JavaScript frameworks (eg. React, Angular). It's 100% hand written (and auto-completed :) ) code.</p>

        <p class="about-p">Obviously I am planning to learn a JavaScript framework in the future but i feel like my knowledge in JS isn't enough yet.</p>

        <p class="about-p">If you've got any new ideas for improvements for this website, do not hesitate to contact me by visiting my contact page.</p>
